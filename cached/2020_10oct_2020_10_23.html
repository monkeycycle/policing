<h1>October 23, 2020 Media Release</h1>

 
  <h2><a name="serious" id="serious"></a>Seven puppies welcomed into WPS K9 breeding program </h2>


			    <p>On September 1, 2020, the Winnipeg Police Service K9 Unit proudly  welcomed seven new puppies into its in-house breeding program.&nbsp; The  puppies and mother, Police Service Dog (PSD) Ellie, are all doing well!</p>
                <p>This is the first  time a litter has been bred through the program using artificial insemination. </p>
                <p>The process has allowed us to combine the highly sought-after  traits of former PSD Judge and PSD Ellie to ensure the highest quality K9s are  working alongside officers in the community's service. <img src="images/pup2.png" alt="" width="300" height="201" align="right"/></p>
                <p>Nine years ago, samples from Judge were taken and frozen for breeding  future litters. This K9 displayed highly sought-after traits, making him a  suitable candidate for the breeding program.Â  </p>
                <p>During Judge&rsquo;s 10-year career, he assisted in more than 500  arrests and sired over 45 puppies, six of which are currently working for the  Winnipeg Police Service.&nbsp;Judge retired in 2014 and passed away in 2015. </p>
                <p>In May 2019, the K9 Unit purchased Ellie from a breeder in Minnesota.  She&rsquo;s proven herself to be an excellent police service dog, making her the  choice for carrying this litter.Â </p>
                <p>In partnership with Dr. Erica Anseeuw and the team at the  Stonewall Veterinary Hospital, Ellie was monitored in preparation for this  procedure to pinpoint the crucial 12-hour window in which the frozen samples  could be implanted to ensure success. &nbsp; </p>
                <p>The insemination was  successfully performed on July 3, 2020, ensuring Judge's legacy continues.&nbsp; </p>
                <p>We are very thankful to all involved who ensured this was a success.&nbsp;<br>
                  Each of these pups will be trained as police dogs for our Service  and other agencies.<img src="images/pup3.png" alt="" width="300" height="201" align="right"/></p>
                <p>The Winnipeg Police Service in-house breeding program was  established in 1999.Â  It is one of the  only breeding programs run by a municipal service in Canada. With the primary  mandate of ensuring the best possible K9 candidates for Winnipeg, the program  has also supplied K9s to police agencies as far away as Salt Lake City, Utah,  Plymouth, Minnesota and police departments in western Canada. </p>
						 <h2><a name="impaired" id="impaired"></a>Impaired Driving â Arrest: C20-247235 </h2>
						 <p>During  the evening of October 17, 2020, members of the Traffic Division were  conducting impaired driving enforcement in the WPS Checkstop van throughout the  city.<br>
                           <br>
At approximately 2:20 a.m., a vehicle passed the Checkstop van at a high rate  of speed. While travelling on Pembina Highway near Grant Avenue, the car weaved  within its lane and had the 4-way flashers activated.</p>
                         <p>Soon  after, officers observed an infant in a child seat in the vehicle, which rapidly  accelerated. Officers attempted to catch up to the car at 90 km/h, but it  continued to pull away. The emergency lighting was activated on the Checkstop  van, and the vehicle continued through the Confusion Corner area at a high rate  of speed.</p>
                         <p>The vehicle  eventually came to a stop on Donald Street at Gertrude Avenue, and the driver  exited with his hands in the air and laid down on the roadway. He was taken  into custody soon after.</p>
                         <p><strong>A 23-year-old male of Winnipeg</strong> has been charged with:</p>
                         <p>- Operation of a  Conveyance While Impaired to Any Degree by BAC or Drug or a Combination of Both<br>

                         <p>He was detained in custody.</p>
                      <p>The name of the  accused is not being released to protect the identity of the child.</p>
<h2><a name="impaired2" id="impaired2"></a>Impaired Driving & Firearm â Arrest: C20-250071 </h2>
<p>On October  21, 2020, at approximately 10:55 a.m., a West District General Patrol unit  observed a stolen vehicle with front-end damage in the 800 block of Bannatyne Avenue.  Officers safely stopped the vehicle, and the male driver was taken into  custody.</p>
<p>A search  of the vehicle and driver resulted in the seizure of a sawed-off .22 calibre  rifle along with ammunition. Officers also determined that the male was  impaired. The vehicle had been reported stolen between October 19-20 from the  Minto neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The male  driver had previously been arrested for a second impaired driving offence  during the evening of October 11, 2020, when he was observed by a K9 Unit  driving erratically at a high rate of speed in the area of Logan Avenue and  McPhillips Street.
