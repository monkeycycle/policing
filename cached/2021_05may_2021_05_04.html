<h1>May 4, 2021 Media Release</h1>

 
  <h2><a name="stabbing" id="stabbing"></a>Stabbings â Investigations</h2>
  <p>During just over six hours between May 3 and May 4,  2021, members of the Winnipeg Police Service responded to three  stabbing-related incidents:</p>
  <p>- On May 3, 2021, at approximately 4:15 p.m.,  Central District officers responded to the area of Portage Avenue and Balmoral  Street for a report that someone had been stabbed. <br>
    Police located an injured 22-year-old female who  had been stabbed. Officers provided emergency first-aid until the Winnipeg Fire  and Paramedic Service arrived and transported the victim to hospital in  unstable condition where she was later upgraded to stable condition. No arrests  have been made at this time. The Major Crimes Unit is continuing this  investigation. </p>
  <p>- On May 3, 2021, at approximately  10:35 p.m., members of the Winnipeg Fire and Paramedic Service  were flagged down in the 400 block of Selkirk Avenue by a male indicating that  he had been stabbed and requesting medical assistance. An injured 30-year-old  male was transported to hospital in unstable condition. Central District  officers met with the victim, who had been upgraded to stable condition. It is  believed the victim was stabbed during a robbery near a convenience store in  the area of Salter Street and Flora Avenue. No arrests have been made at this  time; the investigation was turned over to the Major Crimes Unit for follow-up. </p>
  <p>- On May 4, 2021, at approximately 12:25 a.m., a  call was made to 911 to report a male who had been stabbed in the area of  Mountain Avenue and Aikins Street and was lying in the roadway. North District  officers responded and located an injured 35-year-old male who had been stabbed  and assaulted with a substance believed to be bear spray. He was transported to  hospital in stable condition but was not willing to provide details to the  police. No arrests have been made; the Major Crimes Unit is continuing this  investigation.Â  </p>
  <p><strong>Anyone with information regarding any of these  incidents is asked to contact investigators in the Major Crimes Unit at  204-986-6219 or Crime Stoppers at 204-786-TIPS (8477).</strong></p>
<h2><a name="weapons" id="weapons"></a>Weapons Incident at HQ â Arrest: C21-98354</h2>
<p>On May 3,  2021, at approximately 3:30 p.m., a male attended the Winnipeg Police Service  HQ building, where he was observed to be pacing outside the front entrance and  appeared to be agitated. Soon after, the male entered the front vestibule area  and told security members that he had a firearm.</p>
<p>The  station duty area was evacuated while officers confronted the male. He  subsequently threw the handgun to the ground and was safely taken into custody.</p>
<p>The male,  a 43-year-old of Winnipeg, was found to be wearing body armour and had a  tactical knife in his possession. The pistol was determined to be a BB calibre  handgun designed to closely resemble a Beretta model 92.</p>
<p><img src="images/firearm.jpg" width="500" height="322" alt=""/></p>
<p>He was  later transported to a hospital to be medically assessed and is facing charges  of:</p>
<p>- Possession  of a Weapon (x2)<br>
  -  Carrying Concealed Weapon Prohibited Device or Ammunition<br>
  - Possess  body armour without a valid permit or in a manner inconsistent with the valid  permit (The Body Armour and Fortified Vehicle Control Act)</p>
<h2><a name="found" id="found"></a>Found Urn â Public Assistance Requested: C21-98212</h2>
<p>The Winnipeg Police Service is asking the public for help  with locating the owner of a sealed urn that was turned into a Winnipeg-area  thrift store over the weekend.</p>
<p>It is believed that the urn may have been inadvertently  dropped off or brought to the business by someone other than the owner.</p>
<p><img src="images/urn.jpg" width="510" height="300" alt=""/><img src="images/urn2.jpg" width="193" height="300" alt=""/></p>
<p>The urn is described as a wooden box with gold handles and a  silver/black cross on the top of it.</p>
<p><strong>Anyone with information regarding the owner is asked to  contact the Winnipeg Police Service&rsquo;s Evidence Control Unit at 204-986-6280.</strong></p>
