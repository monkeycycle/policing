<h2><a name="homicide" id="homicide"></a>Homicide â Investigation: C21-132929</h2>
<p>On June 10, 2021, shortly after midnight,  Central District officers responded to the 300 block of Kennedy Street for  reports that someone had been shot. </p>
<p>Upon  arrival, officers located a male lying outside who had been shot and was  seriously injured. They provided emergency first-aid to this male; until he was  transported by ambulance to hospital in critical condition, where he later  succumbed to his injuries.</p>
<p>The deceased victim has been identified as <strong>Marlon Jose CHAMORRO-GONZALES, 48, of  Winnipeg</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>This investigation  is continuing by members of the Homicide Unit. Anyone with information that may  assist investigators is asked to call the Homicide Unit 204-986-6508 or Crime  Stoppers at 204-786-TIPS (8477).</strong></p>
<h2><a name="stabbing" id="stabbing"></a>Stabbing â Investigation: C21-132964</h2

<p>On June 10, 2021, at approximately 1:00  a.m., Central Patrol officers were guarding a scene in the area of Ellice  Avenue and Kennedy Street for what was later determined to be the homicide  mentioned in the above release. </p

<p>An adult male not related to the scene who  had been stabbed approached the officers and requested their assistance. The officers  provided emergency first-aid to the 47-year-old victim, who was subsequently transported  to hospital by ambulance in unstable condition. He was later upgraded to stable  condition; however, he could not provide any suspect information or details of  the assault at this time. </p>
<p><strong>This investigation is ongoing; anyone  with information is asked to contact the Major Crimes Unit at 204-986-6219.  Additional information can be relayed anonymously to Crime Stoppers at  204-786-TIPS (8477).</strong></p>
<h2><a name="assault" id="assault"></a>Assault with a Firearm â Investigation: C21-132989</h2>
<p>On June 10, 2021, at approximately 2:30  a.m., East District officers responded to the 100 block of Henry Avenue, for  the report of a male who had been shot. </p>
<p>The 52-year-old victim had been along the  riverbank near the Disraeli Bridge when he heard shots and realized that he had  been struck. He could not provide any suspect information. Officers provided  first-aid, and he was transported by ambulance to hospital in stable condition. </p>
<p><strong>This investigation is ongoing; anyone  with information is asked to contact the Major Crimes Unit at 204-986-6219.  Additional information can be relayed anonymously to Crime Stoppers at  204-786-TIPS (8477).</strong></p>
<h2><a name="theft" id="theft"></a>Theft of Emergency Vehicle â Arrest: C21-132472</h2>
<p>On June  9, 2021, at approximately 2:00 p.m., the Winnipeg Police Service responded to  the report of an ambulance that had been stolen from the Health Sciences Centre  Winnipeg parking area assigned to Emergency vehicles. </p>
<p>A male  approached an ambulance from the Brandon region, which was parked in the  loading area. He requested assistance from the paramedics who were inside the  ambulance at the time. He immediately climbed in through the back doors and  made his way to the driver's seat. The paramedics exited the ambulance for  their safety, and the suspect drove away, stealing the ambulance. </p>
<p>He drove  to a parking lot in the 1500 block of Wall Street and crashed into a parked  vehicle, where he abandoned the ambulance and fled on foot and ran to the  adjacent 1300 block of Downing Street. While in this neighbourhood, he  continued his erratic behaviour by breaking some windows of residences and  stole an axe from one of the yards. One of the homeowners confronted the  suspect, who then attempted to assault him by swinging the axe, missed and then  fled again on foot. </p>
<p>Officers  searching the area apprehended him while still armed with the axe in a  residential backyard, where he was safely taken into custody. Nobody was  physically injured. </p>
