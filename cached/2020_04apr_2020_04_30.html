  <h3><a name="homicide" id="homicide"></a><strong>Homicide â Public Assistance Requested: C20-54472</strong></h3>
  <p>The Winnipeg Police Service continues to  ask the public for their help with locating <strong></strong>
    <strong>Dylan  James Mousseau, a 22-year-old male of Winnipeg.</strong></p>
  <p><img src="images/mousseau.png" width="300" height="302" alt="Dylan Mousseau wanted for second degree murder"/></p>
  <p>Dylan Mousseau is wanted for Second Degree  Murder for the homicide of <strong>Travis Joel  Johnson, a 37-year-old male of Winnipeg.</strong></p>
  <p>On March 10, 2020, at  approximately 12:02 a.m., members of the Winnipeg Police Service responded to a  report of an injured male at a residence in the 500 block of Elgin Avenue. Upon  arrival, officers located an unconscious adult male with significant injuries.  The victim was conveyed to hospital where he was pronounced deceased.</p>
  <p>Members of the Homicide Unit continued with  the investigation and have obtained a Canada-wide warrant for the arrest of Mousseau.</p>
  <p>Mousseau is described as Indigenous in  appearance, 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; in height, approximately 148 lbs in weight and has a thin  build. He has brown eyes and is believed to have short black hair. He is also  known to have animal paw tattoos on both hands.</p>
  <p><strong>The public is cautioned not to approach Mousseau. Anyone with information regarding his  whereabouts is asked to call 911.

     <h3><a name="assault" id="assault"></a><strong>Assault With A Weapon - Arrest: C20-93338</strong></h3>
     <p>On April 29, 2020, at approximately 12:30  p.m., two arborists were working in the area of the Disraeli Freeway and Lily  Street when they were approached by a male who engaged them in a conversation.</p>
     <p>Soon after, without provocation, the male  began to threaten them with an unknown large metal disc-like object. He then  picked up a chainsaw that the arborists had nearby and started walking around  with it.</p>
     <p>The male subsequently started the chainsaw  and began to throttle the saw while waving it around. Both arborists fled to  their truck, and the male started attacking their vehicle with the chainsaw.  The male then attended to the Disraeli Freeway, where he swung the running saw  at passing cars and a cyclist but did not make contact with them.</p>
     <p>Members of the Winnipeg Police Service  arrived and observed the male still in possession of the running chainsaw.  After a short encounter, the male was safely taken into custody. No injuries  were reported.</p>
     <p><strong>Lionel  Adolph Ballantyne, a 36-year-old male of Winnipeg,</strong> has been charged with:</p>
     <p>- Assault with a Weapon (x2)<br>
