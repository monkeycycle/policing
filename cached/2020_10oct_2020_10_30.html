  <h2><a name="community" id="community"></a>Community Notification</h2>
  <p>The Manitoba Integrated High Risk  Sex Offender Unit (MIHRSOU) is a joint forces unit of the Winnipeg Police  Service and the RCMP. MIHRSOU today provides information regarding <strong>Michael James FELLS (also known as Mike  Middleton and Michael Fellis)</strong>, 38 years of age, a convicted sex offender  who is considered high riskÂ  to re-offend in a sexually violent manner  against all females, both adults and children.</p>
  <p><strong>FELLS </strong>will be released from Stony Mountain Institution, Manitoba on  October 29, 2020 after serving a sentence for two counts of failing to comply  with Long Term Supervision Order.</p>
  <p><strong>FELLS </strong>is a designated Dangerous Offender, and upon release, will be  subject to parole conditions, and a ten year Long Term Supervision Order until  2028. He will be prohibited from being in the presence of any children under 18  years, unless accompanied by an adult who is aware of his criminal record, and  approved by his parole supervisor. He will also be prohibited from attending  public parks or swimming areas where children under 16 can reasonably be  expected, daycare centres, school grounds, playgrounds and community centres. <strong>FELLS </strong>will also be subject to a  lifetime weapons prohibition order.</p>
  <p><strong>FELLS </strong>has a history of sexual offences. He is an untreated sex  offender that is deemed high risk to re-offend in a sexually violent manner.  All females, both adults and children are at risk. <strong>FELLS </strong>is expected to take up residence in Winnipeg.</p>
