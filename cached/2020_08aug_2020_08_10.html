  <h2><a name="community" id="community"></a>Community Notification</h2>
  <p>The Manitoba Integrated High Risk Offender Unit (MIHRSOU) is a joint  forces unit of the Winnipeg Police Service and the RCMP. MIHRSOU today provides  information regarding <strong>Brett Russell Jeffrey PILCH</strong>, 55 years of age, a  convicted sex offender who is considered high risk to re-offend in a sexual  manner.</p>
  <p>PILCH will be released from Stony Mountain Institution, Manitoba on  August 7, 2020 after serving a sentence for two counts of failing to comply  with probation order. On March 1, 2018, he received a sentence of 29 months (in  addition to 22 days of pre-trial custody credit). Upon release, PILCH is  expected to take up residence in Winnipeg.</p>
  <p>PILCH has a history of sexual related offences in relation to  females, usually young adult women. Although he has attended sexual offender  treatment in the past, PILCH is still considered high risk to re-offend. Adult  females and older female children are at risk of sexual violence including  harassment as well as possible physical sexual violence.</p>
  <p><img src="images/pilch.PNG" width="757" height="535" alt=""/></p>
  <p><strong>Background information:</strong></p>
  <p>Brett Russell Jeffrey PILCH is a 55 year-old male with a lengthy  criminal record for making indecent phone calls (9 counts) , harassing phone  calls (5 counts), utter threats (7 counts), sexual assault, criminal harassment  (3 counts), assault, failing to comply with probation and recognizance (11  counts), and theft from mail (9 counts).</p>
  <p>Over a period of approximately 30 years, PILCH has repeatedly  engaged in predatory behaviour, where he has sexually harassed women with whom  he has had no prior relationship, by repeated telephone calls that are sexually  and physically threatening, and, by stalking behaviour. This harassing sexual  conduct usually takes place over the telephone, but has, on occasion, taken the  form of direct physical sexual violence. PILCH has repeatedly failed to comply  with probation and recognizance orders by possessing and using a cell phone,  having contact with females under 18 years and being involved in a relationship  with a female while failing to notify his probation officer. He has also  approached unknown females making sexually harassing and threatening comments,  and, on occasion following the females as they tried to avoid contact with  PILCH.</p>
  <p>PILCH has served five federal sentences for his criminal behaviour  described above.</p>
  <p>PILCH will be released on August 7, 2020. He will be subject to the following conditions until August 6, 2022, including:<br>
    â¢ Report to probation officer;<br>
    â¢ Not to have contact with or be in the presence of any female actually or<br>
    apparently under the age of eighteen (18) years, except for unavoidable<br>
    encounters in a public place and except in the company of an adult approved<br>
    in writing, in advance, by Probation Services;<br>
    â¢ Attend, complete and follow the rules of any assessment, treatment,<br>
    counselling, and/or community programming as directed by probation<br>
    officer;<br>
    â¢ Not to possess weapons;<br>
    â¢ Observe a curfew between 12 am and 6 am, except for verifiable emergencies<br>
    or when you are given special permission in writing, in advance, by your<br>
    probation officer, and be subject to curfew checks;<br>
    â¢ Not to have contact and communication with any sex trade worker; and<br>
    â¢ Not to attend any establishment featuring strippers.</p>
  <p>Upon release, PILCH is expected to take up residence in Winnipeg,  Manitoba.</p>
  <p>PILCH has attended sex offender treatment programs, however, he is  still considered high risk to re-offend sexually. Females, particularly young  adult women and older female children, are at risk of sexual violence including  harassment and physical violence.</p>
