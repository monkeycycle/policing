  <p>On February  16, 2021, at approximately 11:30 p.m., the Winnipeg Police Service East  District officers responded to a theft in progress at a dealership in the 700  block of Nairn Avenue.</p>
Two adult males were crawling underneath  vehicles in attempts to remove catalytic converters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;AIR1 assisted and provided containment until officers on the ground  located the two suspects. They were in possession of tools and placed under  arrest.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Although they did not successfully remove the catalytic converters, the vehicles  still sustained damage from their attempts.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Alan William KAY, 37, of  Winnipeg</strong>, was charged with Theft from Motor Vehicle x2.&nbsp;<br>
He was detained in custody.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>A second male, aged 47, of  Winnipeg</strong> was also charged with Theft from Motor Vehicle x2.<br>
He was released on an Undertaking.&nbsp;
   <h2><a name="break" id="break"></a>Break and Enter / Fraud Use of Credit Card â Arrest C21-32951</h2>
   <p>Between November 2020  and February 2021, Winnipeg Police Service (WPS) General Patrol officers and  the Property Crime Unit undertook an extensive investigation involving the  property and fraud-related crimes believed to be perpetrated by the same  suspect.&nbsp;<br id="br29">
     <br id="br30">
These crimes involved break and enters, damage/thefts of vehicles, and  fraudulent use of identity documents and credit cards.&nbsp;<br id="br31">
<br id="br32">
On November 11, 2020, a wallet was stolen from a parked vehicle in the 500  block of Wardlaw Avenue. The suspect in this incident falsified documents to  obtain credit cards in this victim&rsquo;s name.&nbsp;<br id="br33">
<br id="br34">
Between November 26 and November 27, 2020, the suspect used two fraudulently  obtained credit cards and charged approximately $5,000 in the victim&rsquo;s name. &nbsp;<br id="br35">
<br id="br36">
On January 15, 2021, the same suspect broke into three commercial businesses in  the 100 block of Princess Street. He broke into approximately 50 mailboxes, a  storage locker and ten vehicles, taking property.&nbsp;<br id="br37">
<br id="br38">
On January 27, 2021, the suspect stole keys from a vehicle rental business in  the 1600 block of Inkster Boulevard, where he returned after hours and stole a  vehicle valued at over $5000.&nbsp;<br id="br39">
<br id="br40">
On January 28, 2021, the suspect broke into a &nbsp;residence in the 300 block  of Flora Avenue, taking various items.&nbsp;<br id="br41">
<br id="br42">
On February 11, 2021, at 1:20 a.m., the suspect stole a running vehicle parked  in the100 block of Weston Street.&nbsp;<br id="br43">
<br id="br44">
At approximately 1:30 a.m., Central District General Patrol officers observed  this stolen vehicle being operated in the area of Sherman Street and Logan  Avenue. The driver bailed out of the vehicle and fled on foot, where he was  apprehended a short distance later and placed under arrest.&nbsp;<br id="br45">
<br id="br46">
The Property Crime Unit completed the investigation and identified this  individual as the person linked to all of these offences.&nbsp;<br id="br47">
<br id="br48">
<strong id="strong49">Dustin Dean  ZORN, 33, of Winnipeg</strong>, was charged with 26 property and  fraud-related offences and he was detained in custody.&nbsp;<br id="br50">
<br id="br51">
There were approximately 16 victims related to these offences, with over  $40,000 worth of damaged and stolen property.&nbsp;</p>
	<h2><a name="weapons" id="weapons"></a>Weapons â Arrest: C21-36983</h2>
	<p>On February 16, 2021, at 5:59 p.m., Central  District General Patrol officers responded to the area of Logan Avenue and  Bushnell Street for a report of a male armed with a firearm. </p>
    <p>A 44-year-old male victim was in his parked  truck when a suspect approached and pointed a gun at him for unknown reasons.  The suspect then began to taunt the victim.</p>
    <p>Soon after, a police supervisor unit became  involved in a foot pursuit with the suspect and took him into custody in the  300 block of Patrick Street. The suspect had attempted to discard the firearm  during the chase, but it was recovered and found to be an improvised firing  device (&ldquo;zip gun&rdquo;).</p>
    <p>The  victim and suspect were not known to each other, and methamphetamine use is  believed to have played a role in the incident.</p>
    <p><strong>Arieal Moriah Brown, a 30-year-old male  of Winnipeg</strong>, has  been charged with:</p>
    <p>- Assault  with a Weapon<br>
      - Possession  of a Weapon</p>
    <p>He was  detained in custody.</p>
<h2><a name="robbery" id="robbery"></a>Robbery/Carjacking â Arrest: C21-36288</h2>
<p>On  February 15, 2021, at 9:37 p.m., members of the Winnipeg Police Service  responded to a report of a taxi driver that had just been carjacked.</p>
<p>A  41-year-old male victim had picked up a fare in the first 100 block of Furby  Street and was asked to drive to the area of Salter Street and Manitoba. While  on the way, the fare became belligerent and aggressive â at one point  threatening to stab the driver. Upon arriving at the destination, the driver feared  for his safety and fled the taxicab. The fare chased the driver around the  vehicle before stealing it.</p>
<p>Soon  after, AIR1 located the stolen taxi in a rear lane of the 300 block of Boyd  Avenue. A male suspect was observed to exit the vehicle and attend to a  residence in the 300 block of Redwood Avenue. Officers converged on the house  and took the suspect into custody. He was found be in possession of the taxi&rsquo;s  camera and fuse box, which had been forcibly removed from the vehicle after it  had been taken (causing damage).</p>
<p>Members  of the Major Crimes Unit continued with the investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Roger Knott, a 27-year-old male  of Winnipeg,</strong> has  been charged with:</p>
<p>- Robbery<br>
  - Theft  Under $5000<br>
  -  Mischief Under $5,000/Obstruct in Enjoyment<br>
  -  Uttering Threats - Cause Death or Bodily Harm<br>
  - Drive  without licence or with invalid licence</p>
<p>He was  detained in custody.</p>
