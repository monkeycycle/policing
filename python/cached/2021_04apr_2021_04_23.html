<h1>April 23, 2021 Media Release</h1>

 
  <h2><a name="us" id="us"></a>U.S. Counterfeit Money Scam â Public Advisory: E21-7226</h2>
  <p>During the month of  April, the Winnipeg Police Financial Crimes Unit has received several reports  of counterfeit U.S. money being used to pay for items sold via online  classified ad platforms.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
During face-to-face transactions, the buyer requested to pay with U.S. money.  Once the seller deposited the money at their financial institution, it became  apparent the money was counterfeit, and the customer ultimately incurred a  financial loss.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
If you cannot confirm the legitimacy of any type of currency, please accept  another form of payment.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Remember as always, caution is key in preventing yourself from being  victimized. Buy and Sell Exchange Zones are located at each of the four&nbsp;<a href="https://www.winnipeg.ca/police/abouttheservice/districts.stm">Winnipeg Police  Service Stations</a>.&nbsp;Use these locations to conduct legal buy and sell  transactions.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.winnipeg.ca/police/TakeAction/buy_and_sell.stm">https://www.winnipeg.ca/police/TakeAction/buy_and_sell.stm</a><br>
&nbsp;<br>
Should you be victimized by a fraudster, please report it using the online  reporting system. Awareness for our investigators and the public are critical  in curtailing such crimes.<br>

<h2><a name="fake" id="fake"></a>Fake Alprazolam Pills Found to Contain Other Drugs â Public Advisory</h2>
<p>Members of the Guns  &amp; Gangs Unit have recently received reliable information that a number of  counterfeit Alprazolam (Xanax) pills have been found to contain fentanyl or  other unknown synthetic drugs.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As part of ongoing education efforts, the Winnipeg Police Service wishes to  remind those who illicitly use drugs that what they are taking may contain  dangerous substances such as unsafe cutting agents or other narcotics. These  substances may sometimes lead to severe harm or death.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Winnipeg Police Service encourages anyone who experiences or witnesses a  drug overdose to contact 911 immediately. The Good Samaritan Drug Overdose Act  provides some legal protection for people who seek emergency help for an  overdose and anyone at the scene when help arrives. For detailed information on  the Good Samaritan Drug Overdose Act, please visit Health Canada's website at <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/substance-use/problematic-prescription-drug-use/opioids/about-good-samaritan-drug-overdose-act.html">https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/substance-use/problematic-prescription-drug-use/opioids/about-good-samaritan-drug-overdose-act.html</a>.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
To reduce the risk of an overdose, never use drugs alone and always carry  Naloxone if opioids may be present. For more information on where you can find  Naloxone, please visit Street Connections' website at <a href="http://streetconnections.ca/content.php?navigation_id=2294">http://streetconnections.ca/content.php?navigation_id=2294</a><br>
&nbsp;<br>
Anyone with information regarding drug trafficking is asked to call Crime  Stoppers at 204-786-TIPS (8477). Tips can also be submitted online at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.winnipegcrimestoppers.org/">https://www.winnipegcrimestoppers.org/</a>.<br>

<h2><a name="traffic" id="traffic"></a>Traffic Division urges motorists to be responsible, respectful on roadways</h2>
<p>Springtime  brings warmer temperatures and a chance for car enthusiasts to once again take  their vehicles onto the streets.&nbsp;<br>
The vast  majority of individuals who operate vehicles on cruise night choose to do so in  a responsible, respectful and legal manner while adhering to the current public  health orders.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
However, the Winnipeg Police Service continues to receive complaints regarding  racing, as well as the dangerous and noisy operation of motor vehicles. These  complaints come from all areas of the city.<br>
<br>
This weekend, members of the Traffic Division will be available at various  locations to address these issues and ensure that motorists are abiding by the  Highway Traffic Act.<br>
<br>
The community is reminded that traffic complaints can be reported online for  the attention of the Traffic Division. Such incidents may involve aggressive  driving and/or a traffic violation or repeated traffic issue at a given  location:<br>
â¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;stop sign or red light infractions&nbsp;<br>
â¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;excessive speeding&nbsp;<br>
â¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;distracted or careless driving&nbsp;<br>
â¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;unsafe passing of a school bus; or&nbsp;<br>
â¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;speeding in school zones</p>
<a href="https://winnipeg.ca/police/report/default.stm#traffic">https://winnipeg.ca/police/report/default.stm#traffic</a><br>
