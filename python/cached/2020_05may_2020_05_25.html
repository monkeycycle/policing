<h3><a name="homicide" id="homicide"></a><strong>Homicide â Arrest: C20-116905</strong><br>
  </h3>
<p>On May  24, 2020, at 3:00 p.m., members of the Winnipeg Police Service responded to a  Winnipeg Transit bus in the area of Colony Street and Ellice Avenue for a  report of a stabbing.</p>
<p>Upon  arrival, officers located an injured male and took a suspect into custody. The  victim was transported to hospital in critical condition where he succumbed to  his injuries.</p>
<p>The  deceased victim has been identified as <strong>Raymond Wesley Hill, a 57-year-old  male of Winnipeg.</strong></p>
<p>Members  of the Homicide Unit continued with the investigation.</p>
<p>It is  believed that the suspect and victim had boarded the transit bus at a nearby  stop. As the bus drove, the suspect started an unprovoked altercation with the  victim, which escalated to the suspect brandishing a knife and stabbing the  victim. The bus came to a halt, and the victim flagged down a passing police  unit before collapsing. Officers provided first aid and boarded the bus, at  which time the suspect was taken into custody.<br>
  <br>
  It does not  appear the suspect and victim knew each other before the assault.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Gabriel James, a 46-year-old male  of Winnipeg,</strong> has  been charged with:</p>
<p>-  Manslaughter</p>
<p>He was  detained in custody.</p>
<p>Investigators are  seeking a passenger that witnessed the altercation but left the bus before  speaking with police. The passenger is asked to call the Homicide Unit at 204-986-6508 or  Crime Stoppers at 204-786-TIPS (8477).</a></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="indecent" id="indecent"></a><strong>Indecent Act â Arrest: C20-117150</strong></h3>
<p>On May  24, 2020, at 9:03 p.m., members of the Winnipeg Police Service responded to the  area of Main Street and Market Avenue for a report of a male who had exposed  himself to a 23-year-old female and was now committing another indecent act.</p>
<p>Upon  arrival, officers located a suspect armed with an object and engaged him in a  foot pursuit. A conducted energy weapon (&ldquo;Taser&rdquo;) was used but was ineffective.  The male was ultimately taken into custody in the 500 block of Main Street and  was found to be in possession of a metal pipe.</p>
<p><strong>A 30-year-old male of Winnipeg</strong> has been charged with:</p>
<p>-  Indecent Act<br>
  - Resist  Peace Officer<br>
  - Possession  of a Weapon</p>
<p>He was  detained in custody.</p>
<p>The  male&rsquo;s name is not being released at this time in case there were other  offences in the area around the same time. He is described as having a dark-coloured  beard and a medium build. Anyone that may have been victimized is encouraged to  call the Winnipeg Police Service&rsquo;s non-emergency line at 204-986-6222. </p>

<h3><a name="stolen" id="stolen"></a><strong>Stolen Vehicle â Arrest: C20-76006 & C20-76083</strong></h3>
<p>On April  7, 2020, at approximately 4:15 p.m., emergency personnel responded to Portage  Avenue and Vaughn Street for a report of a collision involving a truck and two  Winnipeg Transit buses.</p>
<p>The  driver of the truck fled and four individuals from the buses were transported  to hospital with minor injuries.</p>
<p>Members  of the Traffic Division continued with the investigation.</p>
<p>It was  determined that the truck had been stolen from a parking lot in the 1100 block  of Arlington Street earlier in the afternoon. The vehicle had been left running  and the victim was retrieving items from the rear seat when the suspect stole  the vehicle. The suspect narrowly missed hitting the driver as he fled in the  truck.</p>
<p>The  stolen vehicle was later involved in the collision with the transit buses after  running a red light that had been active for 16 seconds. Prior to striking the  buses, the suspect narrowly missed several pedestrians that were crossing  Portage Avenue in rush-hour traffic. The suspect attempted to enter a number of  stopped vehicles but ultimately fled on foot.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon Lee Hunter, a 25-year-old male  of Ebb and Flow First Nation,</strong> has been charged with:</p>
<p>- Robbery<br>
  -  Dangerous Operation of a Conveyance<br>
  - Fail to  Comply with Condition of Release Order (x3)<br>
  - Drive  without licence or with invalid licence (Highway Traffic Act)<br>
  - Driver  Fail to Exchange Particulars - To Driver (Highway Traffic Act, x2)<br>
  - Driver  Fail to Exchange Particulars - To Injured Person (Highway Traffic Act, x4)<br>
  - As the  driver of a vehicle involved in an accident, fail to make a Police Report when  the accident meets a criterion requiring the report (Highway Traffic Act)</p>
<p>He was  detained in custody.</p>
