  <h2><a name="robbery" id="robbery"></a>Robbery with Firearm â Arrest: C21-77353</h2>
  <p>On April 7, 2021, at approximately 11:53 p.m., the Winnipeg  Police Service responded to a robbery with a firearm. </p>
    <p>The victim, a 41-year-old male, was walking along Talbot  Avenue near Figuero Street when an unknown adult male approached him. The male  produced a handgun and demanded his wallet and cellphone. </p>
   <p> The victim did not have a wallet but complied and turned  over his cellphone. The suspect subsequently fled the area while the victim ran  to a nearby business and called the police providing the suspect's description. </p>
    <p>Responding East District officers, with the assistance of  the K9 Unit, observed the suspect walking nearby. Upon seeing police, he  attempted to flee but was apprehended a short distance away. Upon arrest, a gun  and a knife were found in the suspect&rsquo;s backpack along with the victim&rsquo;s  property.</p>
    <p>The victim in this incident was not injured. The gun was  determined to be an imitation firearm.</p>
    <p>The investigation was turned over to the Major Crimes Unit.</p>
 <p> <strong>Kristopher  Jordan HOLOMAY, 24</strong>, of Winnipeg, was charged with twelve firearm  and weapon-related offences. He was detained in custody.</p>
<h2><a name="robbery2" id="robbery2"></a>Robbery and Firearm â Arrest: C21-77446 / 45330 / 49033</h2>
<p>The Winnipeg Police Service, Major Crimes Unit, was  actively looking for two adults wanted in connection with a strong-arm robbery  and carjacking that occurred in February and March of 2021.</p>
<ul>
  <li>On February 26, 2021, at approximately 6:45  p.m., a 70-year-old female was waiting for a bus in the lobby at an apartment  in the 400 block of Kennedy Street. An unknown adult male and female approached  her while she was waiting and holding onto her cell phone. <br>
    <br>
    The female snatched the phone from the victim&rsquo;s hand and ran out of the  building. In attempts to retrieve her phone, the victim followed the suspect  outside but had left the rest of her belongings including her walker inside the  lobby and was locked out. <br>
    <br>
    The male then approached the victim while brandishing a metal pipe and  assaulted her by swinging it around her head and shoving her with his hands  while he demanded her passcodes then stole her wallet and belongings. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Both suspects fled the area, and no arrests were made at the time of this  incident. The victim in this incident was shaken up but not injured. <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>On March 3, 2021, at approximately 4:20 p.m., a  58-year-old male home care worker entered the same building in the 400 block of  Kennedy Street. Once inside, the victim was followed onto the elevator by an  unknown male and female who demanded money and his glasses. Upon refusal, the  suspects assaulted the victim by punching him and stealing his belongings,  including a set of car keys.<br>
    <br>
    The two suspects went back downstairs and entered the victim&rsquo;s vehicle parked  out front while brandishing a knife. The victim attempted to thwart the theft,  but was pushed to the ground, as they stole his vehicle. No arrests were made  at the time of this incident. The victim in this incident was not injured. <br>
