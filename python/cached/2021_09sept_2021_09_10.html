  <h2><a name="sexual" id="sexual
	  "></a>Sexual Assaults â Arrests: C21-184715</h2>
  <p>On August 27, 2021, the Winnipeg Police Service released details on an arrest made concerning a sexual assault on August 8, along the river trail behind Churchill High School. Police were also seeking the publicâs assistance and issued safety warnings due to several other assaults that occurred at various points along the river trail between April to August. </p>
  <p>As the result of an extensive investigation by the Sex Crimes Unit, the same adult male has now been charged in relation to four additional incidents that occurred during the aforementioned timeframe.</p>
  <p>On April 8, 2021, at approximately 8:00 p.m., a female in her thirties was walking along the river trail east of the Legislative Grounds. She was attacked from behind and pulled to the ground by an unknown male armed with a knife. A struggle ensued; the female continued to scream loudly, and the suspect let go of her and fled on foot. The female ran to safety and contacted the police. The survivor in this assault sustained a minor physical injury. </p>
  <p>On June 4, 2021, at approximately 4:30 a.m., a female in her twenties was walking in the 300 block of Assiniboine Avenue when she saw an unknown adult male walking nearby and requested to borrow his phone. The male agreed but surreptitiously encouraged her to follow him along Donald Street to afford a better WIFI connection. Once they were at the bridge, the suspect grabbed the female from behind and dragged her down to the riverbank at knifepoint. The female was sexually assaulted, and the suspect subsequently fled on foot. The survivor in this incident contacted the police and received medical attention. </p>
  <p>On June 12, 2021, at approximately 5:30 p.m., a female in her twenties was walking along the river trail near the 200 block of Churchill Drive. She was attacked from behind and pulled to the ground by an unknown male. A struggle ensued; the female continued to scream loudly, and the suspect let go of her and fled on foot. The female ran to safety and contacted the police. The survivor in this assault did not seek medical attention at the time.</p>
  <p>On August 8, 2021, at approximately 5:30 p.m., a female in her twenties was jogging along the river trail near Stradbrook Avenue and Harkness Avenue. An unknown male came up from the riverbank and attacked her. He grabbed hold of her from behind and pulled her to the ground. The victim screamed and was able to escape, while the suspect fled on foot. The survivor in this assault did not seek medical attention at the time. </p>
  <p>On September 9, 2021, members of the Sex Crimes Unit arrested and charged Jordan Andrew BRUYERE, 29, of Winnipeg, with the following offences:</p>
  <p>- Assault (x2)<br>
    - Assault with a Weapon<br>
    - Sexual Assault with a Weapon</p>
  <p>He was detained in custody. </p>
  <h2><a name="mischief" id="mischief"></a>Mischief â Arrest: C21-210876</h2>
  <p>On September 9, 2021, at approximately 7:40 p.m., emergency personnel responded to the area of Sherbrook Street and Wolseley Avenue for a report of a person that had climbed up a crane in a nearby construction site. One caller estimated that the person was about 150 feet up, and another caller reported that the person was about seven stories high.</p>
  <p>Numerous Winnipeg Police Service and Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service (WFPS) resources were dispatched to the area in an attempt to ensure the safety of the individual. As a result, pedestrian and vehicle traffic in the immediate area was restricted or blocked.</p>
  <p>Members from the WFPS Technical Rescue Task Force climbed the ladders that were part of the crane, using rope systems for protection, to access the subject who was unwilling to be lowered by ropes. They subsequently assisted the subject in climbing back down the ladders, where paramedics on scene assessed her.</p>
  <p>Mckayla Treasure Anita MCKAY, a 21-year-old female of Winnipeg, has been charged with:</p>
  <p>- Mischief Over $5,000</p>
  <p>She was detained in custody.</p>
  <h2><a name="robbery" id="robbery"></a>Robbery/Stolen Vehicle â Arrests: C21-210637</h2>
  <p>On September 9, 2021, at 2:33 p.m., West District General Patrol members, with the assistance of the Tactical Support Team, responded to the 600 block of Pembina Highway for a report of a vehicle that had been stolen with a young child inside. The owner of the vehicle, an adult female, had been dragged and injured as she attempted to stop the theft.</p>
  <p>With the help of several witnesses who flagged down responding officers, two suspects â a female and a male â were taken into custody as they attempted to flee the area on foot.</p>
  <p>The victim was later examined by a paramedic but did not require transport to a hopsital.</p>
  <p>Members of the Major Crimes Unit continued with the investigation.</p>
  <p>It is believed that the victim had briefly attended a nearby restaurant for some water and had left a 7-month-old child inside the vehicle. The female suspect entered the vehicle and attempted to drive away at a high rate of speed, at which time the victim was dragged when she tried to stop the theft (with the child still inside). The suspect subsequently drove dangerously around the parking lot in an attempt to pick up her male counterpart, but the vehicle collided with property, and together the two suspects fled on foot.</p>
  <p>The child did not suffer any physical injuries.</p>
  <p>Amie Tamara KITCHEKEESIK, a 34-year-old female of Winnipeg, has been charged with:</p>
  <p>- Robbery<br>
    - Forcible Confinement<br>
    - Dangerous Operation of a Conveyance<br>
    - Assault with a Weapon<br>
    - Fail to Comply with Probation Order</p>
  <p>Daniel GARSON, a 38-year-old male of Winnipeg, has been charged with:</p>
  <p>- Robbery</p>
  <p>Both were detained in custody.<br>
