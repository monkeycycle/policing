  <h2><a name="warrant" id="warrant"></a>Warrant/Weapons Incident â Arrests: C21-45631</h2>
  <p>On February  27, 2021, members of the North District Community Service Unit were granted a  pair of entry warrants for a residence in the 600 block of McGee Street. It was  believed that two males, who were subjects of outstanding arrest warrants, were  at the house (Monkman &amp; Simard).</p>
  <p>At  approximately 11:09 a.m., with the Tactical Support Team's assistance, both  entry warrants were executed. Several individuals exited the residence, including  Monkman, who was taken into custody without incident.</p>
  <p>It was  determined that Simard was still inside, along with another male (Daher, who  was wanted for second-degree murder from a homicide in October 2020 and a  shooting incident in January 2021). Both males were uncooperative, and it was  believed that they could be armed with firearms.</p>
  <p>General  Patrol officers, along with the Armoured Rescue Vehicle (ARV), were deployed.  With the Crisis Negotiation Unit's help, contact was made with the two males â  who were understood to be hiding in an attic.</p>
  <p>Throughout  the afternoon, officers worked diligently in an attempt to take the males into  custody safely. At 6:40 p.m., Daher surrendered to police. About 10 minutes  later, Simard did the same.</p>
  <p>A loaded  sawed-off 12 gauge shotgun, along with ammunition, was later seized from the house.  No injuries were reported throughout the incident.</p>

<p>On October 12, 2020, at approximately 8:00 a.m., a  passerby had been walking their dog in the area of Churchill Drive and Hay  Street when they noticed what appeared to be a deceased person in the Red  River. Emergency personnel responded and recovered the body, which was later  identified as Ahmed.<br>
  <br>
  Members of the Homicide Unit began an investigation,  and it was determined that Ahmed had been murdered at a residence in the Fort  Garry area just days earlier.</p>

<h2><a name="robbery" id="robbery"></a>Robbery â Arrests: C21-45419</h2>
<p>On February 26, 2021, at 10:38 p.m., East District  General Patrol officers responded to the area of Meadowood Drive and St. Anne's  Road for a report of two people that were seen seriously assaulting an adult  female.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, officers located an injured 47-year-old  female. The victim was transported to hospital in stable condition.</p>
<p>A female suspect was found attempting to leave the  immediate area and was taken into custody. With the help of the K9 Unit, two  additional suspects (a male and a female) were tracked to Richfield Avenue and  St. Anne's Road, where they were also taken into custody.</p>
<p>Members of the Major Crimes Unit continued with the  investigation.</p>
<p>It is believed that the victim had been walking in  the area when she was approached by the two young females and asked for money.  When the victim declined, the two pushed her to the ground and attempted to  steal her purse â dragging her a short distance. She was then aggressively  assaulted. A male bystander observed the attack and intervened, pulling one of  the suspects from the victim before they fled.</p>

    <h2><a name="aggravated" id="aggravated"></a>Aggravated Assault â Arrest: C21-45537</h2>
    <p>On February 27, 2021, at approximately 3:05 a.m., members  of the Winnipeg Police Service responded to a pair of stabbing incidents. A  female caller reported she had been stabbed and was in a vehicle on the  Arlington Street Bridge. Another caller reported a male had been stabbed and  was knocking on doors asking for help in the 900 block of Magnus Avenue.</p>
    <p>Officers attended to both locations and located  each victim suffering from serious injuries.

The  male was transported to hospital in unstable condition and later upgraded to  stable condition.</p>
    <p>Members of the Major Crimes Unit continued with the  investigation.</p>
    <p>It is believed that the female victim had  advertised on a social media platform that she was available to be hired for  rides. The suspect (and two acquaintances)  subsequently enlisted her.</p>
    <p>Along with a male victim keeping her company during  the rides, the female victim picked up the three at a residence in the 200  block of Selkirk Avenue. An argument occurred during the ensuing drive, and the  suspect stabbed the two victims numerous times.</p>
    <p>The male victim bailed out of the vehicle as the  three fled at the same time. The female victim drove away and requested help.</p>
    <p>At approximately 4:44 a.m., the suspect was located  at the Selkirk Avenue residence and placed under arrest. Officers later  recovered a knife believed to be involved in the incident from the house.</p>

<p>Police confirmed that a 41-year-old male  employee had been stabbed and conveyed to hospital where he had been admitted  in serious condition but was later upgraded to stable.</p>
<p>A youth has been taken into custody, and  members of the Major Crimes Unit are continuing to investigate. </p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<p>Members  of the Major Crimes Unit continued with the investigation.</p>
