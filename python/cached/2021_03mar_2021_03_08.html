<h1>March 8, 2021 Media Release</h1>

 
  <h2><a name="homicide" id="homicide"></a>Homicide â Update: C21-49918</h2>
  <p><strong>As previously released:</strong></p>
  <p>On March 4, 2021, at 5:59 p.m., members of the Winnipeg  Police Service responded to Main Street and Alfred Avenue for a report that  possible human remains had been found in the area.</p>
  <p>Upon arrival, officers confirmed the remains were that of a  deceased individual. The deceased&rsquo;s age and identity are unknown at this time,  and a post-mortem examination has been scheduled.</p>
  <p><strong>This investigation is continuing by members of the  Homicide Unit.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
  <p>The deceased victim has been identified as <strong>Jana Noella  Williams, a 28-year-old female of Winnipeg.</strong></p>
  <p><img src="images/Jana.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt=""/><img src="images/jana2.jpg" width="250" height="296" alt=""/></p>
  <p>Members of the Homicide Unit are asking the  public for their help with establishing Jana&rsquo;s whereabouts and activities over  the past two weeks. They are also hoping to speak with anyone that she had  recently spent time with.<br>
Â <br>
<strong>Anyone with  information that may assist investigators is asked to call the Homicide Unit  204-986-6508 or Crime Stoppers at 204-786-TIPS (8477).</strong></p>
  <p>Note: The Winnipeg Police Service tries to  avoid the use of police photos for victims, but we feel it is important in this  case. The police photo is the most recent picture that investigators have and  is believed to have the closest resemblance to Jana at the time of her death.  The other image is believed to be two years old. We are providing both images  in an attempt to help with the investigation. Anyone who recognizes Jana and  has information regarding her recent whereabouts is asked to contact police.</p>
<h2><a name="weapons" id="weapons"></a>Weapons â Arrest: C21-51075</h2>
<p>On March 6,  2021, at 6:22 a.m., members of the Winnipeg Police Service began responding to  the area of Main Street and Burrows Avenue after several callers to 911  reported a female walking in traffic with a large knife. The female was acting  erratically and threatening bystanders with the weapon.</p>
<p>A few minutes  later, a Genera Patrol unit located the female near Selkirk Avenue and Charles  Street. Officers communicated with the female and deescalated her to a point  where she dropped the knife. She was safely taken into custody soon after, and  the weapon was seized.</p>
<p><strong>A 20-year-old female of Winnipeg</strong> is facing charges of:</p>
<p>- Possession  of a Weapon<br>
  - Fail to  Comply with Condition of Release Order</p>
<h2><a name="weapons2" id="weapons2"></a>Weapons â Arrest: C21-51476</h2>
<p>On March  6, 2021, at 5:25 p.m., members of the Winnipeg Police Service began responding  to the 1000 block of Main Street after 911 callers reported a male pointing a  firearm at people and buildings in the area. The male had also been in dispute  with a group of people earlier.</p>
<p>A Tactical  Support Team unit arrived in the area and located the male at a nearby bus  shelter with several other individuals. Officers engaged the male and were able  to deescalate the matter, at which time the male discarded the weapon and was  safely taken into custody.</p>
<p>The  weapon was determined to be a .177 calibre CO2 pistol designed to look like a Makarov  semi-automatic handgun replica. </p>
<p>Note: In  the attached pictures, the grip has been moved to the side, and the CO2  cartridge has been removed. A surveillance image showing the incident has also  been provided.</p>
<p><strong>A 20-year-old male of Winnipeg</strong> has been charged with:</p>
<p>- Possession  of a Weapon<br>
  -  Carrying Concealed Weapon Prohibited Device or Ammunition<br>
  - Possession  of Firearm, Restricted/Prohibited Weapon or Ammunition Contrary to Prohibition  Order (x2)</p>
