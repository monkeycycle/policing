                      <p><em><u>As previously released:</u></em></p>
                      <p><em>On July 25, 2020, at approximately 8:00 a.m.,  Winnipeg Police General Patrol officers responded to a report of a male shot in  the 600 block of Ellice Avenue. Officers located a male in his 50&rsquo;s on the  street suffering from a gunshot wound. He was transported to hospital in  critical condition but has since been upgraded to stable. </em></p>
                      <p><em>The investigation led to a residence in the  500 block of Maryland Street. Officers took several people into custody from  within the house. Police presence in the area and the forensic analysis of the  crime scene caused traffic disruptions on Ellice Avenue and Maryland Street for  a number of hours.Â  </em></p>
                      <p><em>Investigators are looking to speak with a  male who initially spoke with two of the first officers to arrive. This male  advised police that he had been a victim of a robbery a short time earlier but  left before being able to provide further details. </em></p>
                      <p><strong><em>The investigation  is continuing by members of the Major Crimes Unit. Anyone with information  regarding this matter is asked to contact investigators  at (204) 986-6219 or Crime Stoppers at (204) 786-TIPS (8477).</em></strong></p>

						<h2><a name="Investigations" id="Investigations"></a><strong>Investigations in Response to Gang-Related Violence Lead to Arrests</strong></h2>
						<p>Between  November 2019 and July 2020, members of the Winnipeg Police Service&rsquo;s Homicide  Unit conducted an extensive investigation in response to increased levels of  gang-related violence in Winnipeg stemming from a fatal shooting at an Exchange  District nightclub.</p>
                        <p>On November 2,  2019, Jamshaid Wahabi, a 23-year-old male, was shot and killed inside Citizen  Nightclub in a dispute between two rival criminal organizations. Following the  shooting, one of Wahabi&rsquo;s associates fired shots at rival gang members outside  of the nightclub. There were numerous bystanders present at this time.</p>
                        <p>After the  homicide, one group began conspiring to murder Wahabi&rsquo;s shooter in an act of  retaliation. On November 4, 2019, Rig Moulebou, a 20-year-old male, was shot  and killed inside a residence on Tim Sale Drive in the South Pointe area.</p>
                        <p>The investigaiton  was subsequently started and focused on several known gang associates.</p>
                        <p>On November 7,  2019, following Jamshaid Wahabi&rsquo;s funeral, Rami Hagos, a 25-year-old male, was  stopped by officers and a .50 calibre Desert Eagle handgun was seized. An  investigation determined the gun had been trafficked from a straw purchaser in  Winnipeg.</p>
                        <p>On November 8, 2019, a search warrant was  executed at a residence on Marine Drive, and officers seized a total of 22  firearms, including four .50 calibre Desert Eagle  handguns. It was discovered that one firearm was missing from the collection â  and that the missing firearm was the one located upon the arrest of Rami Hagos.  Shane Kulathungam, a 41-year-old male of Winnipeg, was subsequently charged  with two firearm-related offences.</p>
                        <p>Between  February 28, 2020, and March 27, 2020, three suspects were arrested for  first-degree murder regarding the death of Rig Moulebou.</p>
                        <p>In early April  2020, the Winnipeg Police Service&rsquo;s Drug Enforcement Unit began a subsequent  investigation arising from the initial operation, which focused on three high-level  drug traffickers.</p>
                        <p>On April 20,  2020, Controlled Drugs and Substances Act search warrants were executed in the first  100 block of Huppe Bay, the first 100 block of Creek Bend Road and the 200  block of Bonaventure East.</p>
                        <p>A number of individuals were taken into  custody, and the investigation led to the seizure of items including:</p>
                        <p>- Approximately  5 kilograms of cocaine (estimated street value of $450,000)<br>
                          - Approximately  2.5 kilograms of a cutting agent<br>
                          - Approximately  $190,000 in Canadian currency<br>
                          - A large amount  of packaging material along with a money counter and a scale.<br>
                          - 13 mobile  phones<br>
                          - Gold  jewellery (estimated value of $20,000)</p>
                        <p>Throughout the  investigations, police determined that some of the males were responsible for  other offences, and they were subsequently charged. Some of the charges were in  relation to benefiting their criminal organization.</p>
