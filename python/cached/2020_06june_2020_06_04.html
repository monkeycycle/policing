  <p>The Winnipeg Police Service is requesting  the public&rsquo;s assistance in locating a missing 16-year-old female. </p>
  <p>HATHER was last seen on May 22, 2020 in the  Weston area of Winnipeg, Manitoba. She has been active on social media within  the past several days. </p>
  <p>HATHER is described as Indigenous, 5&rsquo;5, with  an average build, brown hair and brown eyes.Â   It is unknown what she was wearing at the time.</p>
  <p><img src="images/hather.png" width="398" height="414" alt=""/></p>
  <p>Police are concerned for HATHER&rsquo;S  well-being and are asking anyone with information regarding her whereabouts to  contact the Winnipeg Police Service Missing Persons Unit at 986-6250.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="eduardo" id="eduardo"></a><strong>Missing Person â Eduardo Balaquit: C18-117917</strong></h3>
<p>Today marks two years since the disappearance of  Eduardo Balaquit, who went missing during the evening of Monday, June 4, 2018.</p>
<p><img src="images/balaquit.JPG" width="408" height="267" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eduardo  is approximately 5&rsquo;4&rdquo; tall and 155 lbs in weight with a medium build. He is  Asian in appearance, has black hair/brown eyes and was last seen wearing a  black zip-up sweater, black pants and black shoes. Eduardo was 59 years old at  the time of his disappearance, and would now be 61 years old.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg  Police Service&rsquo;s Homicide Unit continues to investigate his disappearance. It  is believed that Eduardo became a victim of crime shortly after he arrived for  work at a business in the 300 block of Keewatin Street on June 4, 2018, at  approximately 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Homicide  Unit investigators continue to seek information about a blue 2010-2015 Ford  Escape SE thought to be involved in Eduardo&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>

<p>Stock images (not the actual vehicle) </p>
<p>Investigators have concluded that the vehicle had likely been in the  area of Eduardo&rsquo;s work during the time of his disappearance and travelled to  the Arborg area soon after.</a></p>
<p>It is also believed that evidence related to Eduardo&rsquo;s disappearance  may still be undiscovered in the Arborg area, or the regions between Winnipeg  and Arborg. </a>Investigators  would like to remind the public, including those in rural areas, to be aware of  any unusual items they may find in the area. Items that may seem insignificant  to the casual observer may have significant relevance to the investigation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We highlight this case once again because  we know someone, somewhere knows more about what happened to Eduardo. We&rsquo;ve  taken important steps forward with this investigation, but we appeal to the  community to help us close this case for Eduardo&rsquo;s family â for the community.  We need your help.&rdquo; said Sergeant Wade McDonald of the Homicide  Unit. &ldquo;Eduardo was an extremely hard worker and a family man. His family is  desperately searching for answers. His family wants and deserves answers â as does  our entire community. If you think you recognize this vehicle or have  information, please contact the Homicide Unit or Crime Stoppers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Statement from Eduardo&rsquo;s family: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long  and difficult two years. Our only wish is for our dad to walk through our doors  and finally say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m home.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s never too late to do the right thing, if you  have any information, please help us bring him home.&rdquo;</p>
<strong>Anyone with information that can assist in this  investigation is asked to contact the Winnipeg Police Service Homicide Unit at  204-986-6508 or Crime Stoppers at 204</strong>
<hr><h3><a name="homicide" id="homicide"></a><strong>Homicide â Public Assistance Requested: C20-113477</strong></h3>
<p><strong>As previously released:</strong></p>
<p>On May  21, 2020, at approximately 9:30 a.m., General Patrol members responded to a  residence in the 700 block of Selkirk Avenue for a report of a male that had  been shot. </p>
<p>Upon  arrival, officers located an adult male on the front steps of the house  suffering from gunshot wounds. The victim was transported to hospital in  critical condition where he was pronounced deceased. </p>
<p>The  deceased victim has been identified as <strong>Nairne Marshall James Chapais, a  23-year-old male of Winnipeg.</strong></p>
<p>Members  of the Homicide Unit continued with the investigation.</p>
<p>On May  27, 2020, two male suspects were located at a hotel in the 200 block of  McDermot Avenue and placed under arrest by members of the Tactical Support Team  with the assistance of General Patrol officers. A firearm was recovered, and a  small amount of cocaine was seized from one of the males.</p>
<p>Investigators  believe that the homicide was premeditated and gang-related. The victim had  been socializing in the area when he was shot as he returned to the building he  lived in. It was also determined the building had been shot at three days  earlier as well.</p>

  <br>
  He was  detained in custody.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong></p>
<p>Homicide  Unit investigators have obtained a Court Order authorizing the publication of  the identity of a youth suspect sought in connection with the homicide. </p>
<p><strong>A Canada-wide warrant for First Degree Murder  has been issued.</strong> *We have removed the name and picture of the suspect as the court order authorizing the publication of his identity has expired.</p>
<p><strong>The public is cautioned not to approach him. Anyone with information  regarding his whereabouts is asked to call 911. Additional information that may  assist investigators can be relayed to Homicide Unit investigators at 204-986-6508  or Crime Stoppers at  204-786-TIPS (8477).</strong></p>
<p>Note:Â  This court order ceases to have effect on Monday,  June 8, 2020, at 11:59 p.m.Â  Media  outlets are reminded not to publish images of him or name him after that  time.</p>
