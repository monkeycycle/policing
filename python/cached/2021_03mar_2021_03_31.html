  <h1>March 31, 2021 Media Release</h1>

 
 <h2><a name="robbery" id="robbery"></a>Robbery â Arrests: C21-69085</h2>
 <p>On March 28, 2021, Winnipeg Police General  Patrol Officers began investigating a series of violent incidents that occurred  during the morning hours in the area of William Avenue and Sherbrook Street.</p>
 <p>The first incident occurred at 7:15 a.m.  The victim, a male in his 40s, was walking to work in the lane between Elgin  Avenue and William Avenue near Tecumseh Street when he was confronted by three  teenage males who threatened to shoot him if he didn't turn over his money. The  victim replied that he had no money and started to walk past when he was shoved  to the ground and had his sunglasses stolen. Officers in the area quickly responded.  They located the victim's sunglasses, but the suspects had left the area.  Officers then met the victim at a nearby hospital where he had gone for  treatment. </p>
 <p>At 8:05 a.m., the same officers responded  to a second incident, which they quickly linked to the previous call. This  victim, a male in his 30s, was confronted by three teenage males near Tecumseh  Street and Ross Avenue. The suspects demanded money and his duffel bag. He  explained that he had no money, but the suspects knocked him to the ground and  began assaulting him. His duffel bag was stolen but later recovered in the area  by officers. The victim was treated for head and upper-body injuries.</p>
 <p>The third incident occurred at 7:45 a.m.  but was not reported until awhile later. The victim, a female in her 60s, was  walking to her car after finishing work. While in the 600 block of Ross Avenue,  the victim was confronted by three teenage males. One threatened to shoot her  for walking in the area, then made a sexually suggestive comment. An adult male  stranger intervened and drove the victim to her parked car, but not before the  teens threw objects striking the stranger's truck. </p>
 <p>In the fourth incident, the male victim  (30s) left a drug store in the 700 block of Sherbrook at 7:45 a.m. when he was  approached by three teenage males that began following him. The suspects  demanded his money or backpack, which he refused. The victim fled when the  suspects threatened to stab him. The victim ran to a residence in the area  where he was let in and locked the door. The suspects followed him, and one  threw an object through the front window, causing approximately $3,000 damage  before fleeing. <br>
   <br>
   At 11:15 a.m., officers located all three  suspects in a parking lot in the 600 block of Notre Dame Avenue.Â  The three suspects, aged 12, 13, and 14 years  face charges arising from the noted incidents:<br>
   - Robbery x 3<br>
   - Assault with Weapon<br>
   - Break &amp; Enter &amp; Commit Robbery<br>
   - Assault with Weapon<br>
   - Mischief Under $5,000<br>
   - (one accused â Possess Weapon)</p>
 <p>As prescribed by the Criminal Code, all  three were released on Undertakings with June 2021 court dates. </p>

- MDMA with an estimated street value of  $32,000<br>
- Approximately $1,000 in Canadian currency</p>
 <p>Both the driver and the passenger were  arrested. </p>
