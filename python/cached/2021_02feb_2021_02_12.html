  <h2><a name="homicide" id="homicide"></a>Homicide Update â Arrest: C20-173625</h2>
  <p>On  February 11, 2021, the Winnipeg Police Service, Homicide Unit arrested and  charged <strong>Rahim AHMADZAI</strong>, <strong>19, </strong>for the death of <strong>Ryan Kelly LEGARY. <br>
      <br>
LEGARY </strong>was killed on July 23, 2020, and the Homicide Unit followed up on this  investigation. </p>
  <p>The two  men who were unknown to each other became involved in a road-rage incident in  the area of Lagimodiere Boulevard and Fermor Avenue. They pulled into a nearby  parking lot where a verbal dispute escalated, which ended in Rahim AHMADZAI  stabbing LEGARY, who subsequently succumbed to his injuries. </p>
  <p><strong>Rahim AHMADZAI</strong> of Winnipeg has been charged with  Manslaughter and was detained in custody. </p>
  <p><strong><em><u>As previously  released:</u></em></strong></p>
  <p><em>On July 23, 2020, at approximately 5:25 p.m.,  Winnipeg Police responded to a report of a male stabbed in a parking lot at the  northwest corner of Lagimodiere Boulevard and Fermor Avenue. </em></p>
  <p><em>An adult male was transported to hospital in  critical condition but succumbed to his injuries. The victim has been  identified as Ryan Kelly LEGARY, 43. </em></p>
<h2><a name="stolen" id="stolen"></a>Stolen Vehicle â Arrest: C21-33619</h2>
  <p>On February 11, 2021, at approximately  10:20 p.m., Winnipeg Police Service General Patrol officers from the North  District observed a stolen Dodge Caravan near McGregor Street and Mountain  Avenue. Officers did not pursue the vehicle, but put out a Stop Stick (tire  deflation device) on Salter Street and Redwood Avenue. The van ran over the  Stop Stick but then accelerated at high speed, attempting to flee. The driver  continued south on Salter, running a red light at Burrows Avenue, where it  struck another vehicle travelling westbound. Both vehicles were rendered  inoperable. </p>
  <p>The driver of the struck vehicle was  transported to hospital, where he was treated and released. The suspect driver,  a 17-year-old male and a 14-year-old female passenger were transported to the  hospital in stable condition. A large knife was located in the front seat. The  intersection of Salter and Burrows was shut down for approximately two hours  due to two light standards being knocked down. </p>
  <p>The driver faces charges of;<br>
    - Operation of a Conveyance while  Prohibited<br>
    - Flight While Pursued by Police<br>
    - Possess Property Obtained by Crime Under  $5,000<br>
    - Dangerous Operation of a Conveyance<br>
    - Possess Weapon<br>
    - Fail to Comply with Sentence</p>
  <p>He was detained in custody. </p>
<h2><a name="police" id="police"></a>Police Pursuit â Arrest: C21-33796</h2>
 <p>On February 12, 2021, at approximately 1:30  a.m., Winnipeg Police Service General Patrol officers from Central District  attempted a traffic stop of a Jeep Patriot near the intersection of Portage  Avenue and Memorial Boulevard after observing several HTA infractions. The  driver refused to stop and proceeded to drive through a red light. The Jeep  fled, reaching speeds of approximately 100 Km/h. Officers did not pursue the  vehicle out of concerns for public safety and called for the assistance of  Air1. </p>
 <p>Air1 maintained visual containment of the  Jeep as it fled into the Wolsely neighbourhood. General Patrol units attempted  to stop the vehicle in the 600 block Westminster where the Jeep collided with a  police cruiser and then struck a building, rupturing the natural gas line. </p>
 <p>The driver was arrested and did not require  medical attention. </p>
 <p>Multiple apartments and residences were  evacuated as a result of the gas leak. Approximately 60 residents were  sheltered in City of Winnipeg transit buses. Winnipeg Fire Paramedic personnel,  along with Manitoba Hydro employees, were able to repair the leak and residents  were allowed to return to their homes at approximately 3:45 a.m. </p>
 <p><strong>Robbie  Kent McLEAN</strong>, 47, was charged with:<br>
   - Dangerous Operation of Conveyance<br>
   - Flight While Pursued by Police<br>
   - Operate a Conveyance While Prohibited<br>
   - Warrant of Arrest for Fail to Comply with  Probation x 2</p>
 <p>He was detained in custody. </p>
<h2><a name="disarming" id="disarming"></a>Disarming a Peace Officer/ Resist â Arrest: C21-33719</h2>
<p>On  February 11, 2021, at 11:30 p.m., Winnipeg Police Service, Central District  Police officers responded to a Wellbeing Call in the residential 1500 block of  Lincoln Avenue. </p>
<p>A call to  911 indicated that a female was being held hostage by an adult family member  under the influence of methamphetamine. </p>
<p>Responding  officers determined that there was no hostage incident taking place; however,  an adult male in the residence displayed significant signs of methamphetamine  use and acting erratically. </p>
<p>Officers  also confirmed this individual had several outstanding warrants. While  attempting to arrest him and place him in handcuffs, the suspect became  combative and tried to remove an officer&rsquo;s conductive energy weapon (CEW) from  his holster but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>A CEW was  ultimately deployed to gain control of this male and place him in handcuffs;  however, it was unsuccessful, and he managed to escape and ran outside. </p>
<p>Once  outside, this individual attempted to steal an unlocked police cruiser car but  was unsuccessful. He proceeded to run away on bare feet despite the extreme  cold temperatures. </p>
<p>Soon  after, officers located the suspect in the 1400 block of Selkirk Avenue, where  he was placed under arrest. His erratic behaviour continued as he displayed  extreme methamphetamine driven behaviour, and received a medical evaluation. </p>
<p><strong>William Richard WOODHOUSE, 30,</strong> of Winnipeg, was charged with: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Disarming a Peace       Officer</li>
  <li>Resist Peace       Officer</li>
  <li>Escape Lawful       Custody</li>
  <li>Theft of Motor       Vehicle</li>
  <li>Fail to Comply       with Condition of Release x 3</li>
  <li>Five warrants       related to failing to attend court and breaching court orders</li></ul>
    <p>He was detained in custody. </p>
